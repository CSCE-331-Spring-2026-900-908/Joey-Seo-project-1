                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm passionate about web development because it lets you build applications that people can interact with immediately. There's something really rewarding about combining 
                    creative design with technical problem-solving to create a great user experience. I enjoy working with modern web technologies to build responsive applications 
                    that work smoothly across different devices. Plus, web development is constantly evolving with new frameworks and tools, which keeps the field interesting and 
                    offers lots of opportunities for growth and learning.

                <h3>Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning</h3>
                <p>
                    AI and machine learning fascinate me because of their potential to solve real-world problems across many industries. I'm interested in how machines can learn 
                    from data to make predictions and decisions, and I think it's amazing how these technologies are being applied to healthcare, autonomous systems, and countless other areas. 
                    The combination of mathematical concepts, data science, and practical implementation makes this field both intellectually interesting and impactful. 
                    I'm excited about the possibilities for using AI to help solve meaningful challenges.
